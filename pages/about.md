Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I've always been passionate about coding, and I'm eager to apply my programming skills to new pursuits. I love to interact with my team setting sharing my skills and knowledge. Having been studied on several programming languages, I can easily learn a new programming language and develop innovative applications. 

I am interested in web technologies, algorithms, artificial intelligence and embedded systems; constantly exploring new technologies.
